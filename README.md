## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/SCSS

### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced my skills in responsive design by using a mobile-first approach. Sass/SCSS allowed me to write more maintainable and reusable CSS. I also practiced using Flexbox for layout management, which provided flexibility across different screen sizes.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts. Additionally, I would like to refine my use of Sass by incorporating mixins to further improve code efficiency and reusability.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This was helpful for understanding Flexbox properties and ensuring the layout is responsive.
- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - Provided insights into leveraging Sass for better CSS organization.
